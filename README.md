## Organização de Igrejas

- Aplicação personalizada, moderna, isenta de pretensões financeiras, e pensado em facilitar e automatizar os trabalhos corriqueiros da secretária executiva, tesouraria da igreja e auxiliar nas tomadas de decisões da Direção.

- O Senhor Jesus esteve presente durante todo desenvolvimento me dando o rumo em meio a tantos códigos. Espero no Deus de Abraão, Isaque e Jacó que o uso deste software ajude a abençoar sua igreja, facilitando trabalhos e lhe permitindo mais tempo e dedicação nas outras áreas da obra de Deus.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
